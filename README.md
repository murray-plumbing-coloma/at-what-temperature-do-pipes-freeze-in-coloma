## Quick Answer (Featured Snippet Ready)

In most homes, **water pipes can begin freezing around 32°F (0°C)**, but the real risk rises when **air temperatures stay at or below 20°F (-6°C) for several hours**, especially with wind exposure, poor insulation, or pipes in unheated areas like crawl spaces, garages, exterior walls, and under sinks.

## Why Pipes Freeze (What Changes the “Freezing Temperature”)

Even though water freezes at **32°F**, pipes often freeze due to **heat loss** and **exposure** factors, including:

- **Pipe location:** exterior walls, attics, crawl spaces, garages  
- **Insulation level:** no insulation or missing vapor barrier  
- **Air leaks:** gaps around plumbing penetrations under sinks / at foundations  
- **Wind chill:** drafts in vented crawl spaces and open eaves  
- **Pipe material & size:** small-diameter lines freeze faster  
- **Water movement:** stagnant water freezes faster than a slow drip  

---

## Coloma-Specific Notes

Coloma homes often include older construction, crawl spaces, and exterior-wall plumbing runs—conditions that increase freeze risk when overnight lows drop sharply. Even short cold snaps can cause frozen sections if pipes are exposed to drafts or uninsulated voids.

---

## What To Do If Pipes Freeze (Safe Steps)

1. **Turn on a faucet** (both hot and cold) to relieve pressure.
2. **Check the obvious cold zones:** under sinks, garage, crawl space access, exterior walls.
3. **Warm the area safely:** space heater (attended), warm towels, or a hair dryer.
4. **Do NOT use open flames** (torch/lighter) near pipes.
5. **If you see bulging, cracks, or leaking:** shut off the main water and call a plumber.
